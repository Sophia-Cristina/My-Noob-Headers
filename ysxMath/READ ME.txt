Since mathematic is "infinite", things here may grown exponentially and i may then create a especial
directory for things inside a math area, a good example is the 'Geo[metry]' and 'Physics' directory,
both started as a mere single header.
The same may happen to other headers. So be aware of changes, old source codes may get errors when looking for
files included here.
If you don't mind about bloating up with headers, just add the 'ysxMath.h' header that it includes other
headers and will be modified in accord.

'ysxMoney.h' seems to be obsolete, i may add economic math and functions here, but in fact i think i may not
because most things related to such things are also related to trading and may be found at 'ysxTrade'
directory.

There may have special personal things here, maths i made myself, like, attempts at making fractals and etc.

Also, ironically, some math things may not be here.
Some math stuffs may be used in especial areas and may be on other directories.
Also, things related to plotting and graphical stuffs are very likely in the 'ysxLibsUtils' directory,
inside lib directories related to graphics.
Ex.: Mandelbrot fractal is not found at 'ysxFractal.h', but at 'ysxLibsUtils/CImg/Plotters/ysxciFractals.h'.
However, i'm thinking about adding at least the mathematical function of Mandelbrot in 'ysxFractal', and then
it may break some codes that uses it.

Since this was one of my first directories ('ysxMath.h' was the first header here and was the sole one),
there is a lot of mess and old conventions that i had.
There are very likely functions and classes i may change or swap from header to header.
Using headers here may ocasionally make you have your code "broken". Take that in mind.
One example is some functions that required variables and i made it that it now uses function pointers.
I'm going to try to maintain as much functions as possible in the way it is and change only the internal stuffs
from it. However, most problems would be dealt by simple including another header.
