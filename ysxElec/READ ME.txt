This is for electronic simulations, systems, maths and etc.
Those may have more precise connection to the field of electrical enginering instead of an approach to the
logical aspects of a computer or alike systems.
For example: in certain headers here (not all), the voltage and voltage noise may be simulated,
in a computer emulation it can be a mere unsigned byte, because in a computer emulation, the emulation
of the logic is what matter most.
And so, in this directory what matter is the fundamental electronic aspects.

If you want related from thigs that are subproducts of electronic devices, you may want to see
those directories:
ysxComputer
ysxData
ysxCode

Since 'Signal Processing' is a special area, and not all signals are necessarily electronic, things related
to it may be found in the 'ysxSignal' directory.
However, this was complex for me to decide and i decided that way because, some useful formulaes for Sig. Proc.
may also be used in electrical engineering, and i don't want to repeat the same codes, and so, if you need
some useful electronic functions that is also used in Sig. Proc., you may find at:
'ysxSignal/ysxSigElec.h'.
However, i highly doubt there are any other useful thing related in the 'ysxSignal' directory.
Unless you may need a signal stream or something in your electronic system, but that would be the same as
needing to use a header in 'ysxComputer' for a system that needs an IC or something like that.
