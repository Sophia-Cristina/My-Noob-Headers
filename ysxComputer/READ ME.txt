This directory is for things directly related to computers, both at hardware and software level.
However, it is not for emulations of electronic circuitry and devices, this can be found on:
'ysxElec' directory.

This is also not related to 'Data' and 'Coding', even if both things are somewhate directly related to
computers, both are special areas of its own.

'Data' is not directly related to computer, even if nowadays it is pretty much used almost generally by
computers, but it can also be used in direct electronic devices that requires no computations, radio
transmission and things like that.
It is also a very expansive field and requires a special attention, and so, things related to data, like:
bytes, protocols, ports & peripherals, Trees, files and etc; are to be found in the directory:
'ysxData'.

'Coding' may not be only for computers, but also a logical parsing and semantical approach for axioms
and tokens and its functionability, and so, i would not consider it "directly" related to computer in
the same way other things in this directory are.
Codings stuffs like, parsers, piping, languages, transpiler and etc can be found at:
'ysxCode' directory.
