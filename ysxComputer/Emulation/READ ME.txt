In:
ysxElec/ysxElecConsts.h
or:
ysxElec/ysxElecDevicesConsts.h
You may find useful constants to devices that certain emulators can use.
The later have NTSC and PAL information.
Never forget the most famous header 'ysxMath/ysxConst.h' for mathematical constant if you need
to simulate some stuffs that needs certain maths in your ROM programming or whatever.

Emulations of devices, like: Game Consoles, Computers and etc; wont have their ICs emulated in
their respective directories.
Instead, those components are going to be emulated on headers at 'ICs' directory or at the 'Emulation'
directory, like: 'ysxEMULowLevel.h'.
This is because there are multiple systems that uses the same ICs, like the 6502 CPU or Z80, and so,
instead of making an emulator for thos components for each system, the systems are going to have a
standardized functionality for those to be able to use the same ICs classes.
The point of that is because my codes are a compilation (in terms of 'a set of') of useful programming
utensils, and so, every header, functions, classes and etc should work by itself for higher degree of freedom.
