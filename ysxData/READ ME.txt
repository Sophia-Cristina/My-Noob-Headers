'Data' is not directly related to computer, even if nowadays it is pretty much used almost generally by
computers, but it can also be used in direct electronic devices that requires no computations, radio
transmission and things like that.
It is also a very expansive field and requires a special attention, and so, things related to data, like:
bytes, protocols, ports & peripherals, Trees, files and etc; are to be found here.
But things directly related to logic, algorithms, emulation and etc are on the directory
'ysxComputer'.

'Coding' may not be only for computers and data, but also a logical parsing and semantical approach for axioms
and tokens and its functionability, and so, i would not consider it "directly" related to computer and data.
Codings stuffs like, parsers, piping, languages, transpiler and etc can be found at:
'ysxCode' directory.
