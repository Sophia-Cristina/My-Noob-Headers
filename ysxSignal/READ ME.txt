Since 'Signal Processing' is a special area, and not all signals are necessarily electronic, things related
to it may be found here, but things related to electronic things and electrical engineering may be found at:
ysxElec.

This was complex for me to decide and i decided that way because, some useful formulaes for Sig. Proc.
may also be used in electrical engineering, and i don't want to repeat the same codes, and so, if you need
some useful electronic functions that is also used in Sig. Proc., you may find at:
'ysxSignal/ysxSigElec.h'.
But if you need some useful electronic functions that may be useful for some Sig. Proc, system, you may
need to look at some 'ysxElec' headers.
However, i highly doubt there are any other useful thing related in the 'ysxSignal' directory.
Unless you may need a signal stream or something in your electronic system, but that would be the same as
needing to use a header in 'ysxComputer' for a system that needs an IC or something like that.

Sig. Proc. is not the same as data structures, even if it may use it, if you want things related to that,
those are at:
ysxData.

The same for things related to codes, even if you can transmit code using Sig. Proc., code is not directly
related to it, neither things that deals with codes, like, compilers, parsers and etc, those utils can be
found here instead:
ysxCode.

Even most systems for Sig. Proc. are computadorized, it is not directly related to computer, as computers
can also deal with other logics. Sig. Proc. is also not directly related to electronical components used in
computers, like, ROMs, RAMs and etc, even if a system may use it. If you need things like that, those can
be found at:
ysxComputer.
