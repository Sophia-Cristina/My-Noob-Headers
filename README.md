# My-Noob-Headers
I'm noob on c++, I just want a back-up of my codes, this is also a way to share with friends, but feel free to enjoy whatever you can with it.
There is nothing advanced and since I use those codes since the beginning of my programming journey, it have lot of rubbish that I'm lazy to fix.
I love to do music and I began to learn programming because music. Since "music is math", I'm enjoying using c++ to make small silly programs to use in other softwares for music.

ysxCImg.h:
Uses the header "CImg" (cimg.eu) to do useful things, some that uses other headers I made;
There is functions that "CImg" header already have, that the "CImg" header do better, but I used to learn;

ysxDoc.h:
Almost empty file I found useful after I had to catalog stuffs, maybe it will become more useful by time;

ysxmath.h:
A math header I made. I'm not very good on math, there is things I know is wrong on this file, yet, I'm either lazy to fix or I'll later, and yet, I think it is useful enough already;
Don't joke me, at least I'm learning and trying... :p

ysxNeural.h:
I saw a video on youtube that taugh how to do a very simple c++ neural net;
Long time I don't mess with this file, there is lot of rubbish, but enjoy it if you can...

ysxPrint.h:
Print in ".txt" useful information. I use this to copy-paste stuffs or to add data to other kind of softwares...

---

ysxCalc.h:
Header to things related to calculus or alike;

ysxConst.h:
Constants;

ysxFractal.h:
Fractals... There is few ones there, one that I made by the way; :p
But I pretend to fill this header one day, as I love fractals and I can make arts with it or even put on musics;

ysxGeo.h:
Header related to Geometry;

ysxPhis.h:
Header related to physics... And I suck at physics, so, don't joke me for being noob at it;

PROGRAMS:
*** NOT SURE IF I'LL POST THOSE, AS THOSE DON'T MATTER TOO MUCH ***

CURL.cpp:
This is my first use of te CURL library, it works, but this file is not complete, you need to use link the libraries in the project configuration;
I saw this on a youtube video, maybe I get the link later.

Matrix2Coll:
This is my program to do things for a software I use for music, Max/MSP, but, PureData also have this object and probably it is compatible with PureData.
