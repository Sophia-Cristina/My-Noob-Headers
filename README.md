# My-Noob-Headers
I'm noob on c++, I just want a back-up of my codes, this is also a way to share with friends, but feel free to enjoy whatever you can with it.
There is nothing advanced and since I use those codes since the beginning of my programming journey, it have lot of rubbish that I'm lazy to fix.
I love to do music and I began to learn programming because music. Since "music is math", I'm enjoying using c++ to make small silly programs to use in other softwares for music.

ysxCImg.h:
Uses the header "CImg" (cimg.eu) to do useful things, some that uses other headers I made;
There is functions that "CImg" header already have, that the "CImg" header do better, but I used to learn;

ysxDoc.h:
Almost empty file I found useful after I had to catalog stuffs, maybe it will become more useful by time;

ysxmath.h:
A math header I made. I'm not very good on math, there is things I know is wrong on this file, yet, I'm either lazy to fix or I'll later, and yet, I think it is useful enough already;
Don't joke me, at least I'm learning and trying... :p

ysxNeural.h:
I saw a video on youtube that taugh how to do a very simple c++ neural net;
Long time I don't mess with this file, there is lot of rubbish, but enjoy it if you can...

ysxPrint.h:
Print in ".txt" useful information. I use this to copy-paste stuffs or to add data to other kind of softwares...

---

ysxCalc.h:
Header to things related to calculus or alike;

ysxConst.h:
Constants;

ysxFractal.h:
Fractals... There is few ones there, one that I made by the way; :p
But I pretend to fill this header one day, as I love fractals and I can make arts with it or even put on musics;

ysxGeo.h:
Header related to Geometry;

ysxPhis.h:
Header related to physics... And I suck at physics, so, don't joke me for being noob at it;

PROGRAMS:
BrlorgProblems.cpp:
No, this is not a sponsor, they don't even need it...
Yes, this is where I try to do my Brilliant.org stuffs... Don't joke me because there is mistakes or failure, hahaha...
I like to solve math problems by programming, as this not only teaches me math, not only it is my notebook, it also teaches me how to solve math problems by programming;
I have this philosophy that programming is the "new math".

TESTESAQUI.cpp:
This is my test zone, there is nothing in this file, it is just a prompt so I have all the tools I need ready to test stuffs...

CIMG arts hihihi =3.cpp:
Not sure if I'll post it here, but in any case, this is where I use my headers to do silly programming arts.
But I change it all the time and make separated files for it, so, it is a giant mess, and some of those files don't even work with the new versions of my headers.

CURL.cpp:
This is my first use of te CURL library, it works, but this file is not complete, you need to use link the libraries in the project configuration;
I saw this on a youtube video, maybe I get the link later.

Matrix2Coll:
This is my program to do things for a software I use for music, Max/MSP, but, PureData also have this object and probably it is compatible with PureData.
