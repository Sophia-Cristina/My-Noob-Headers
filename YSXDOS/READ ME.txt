Things here can be used in modern IDE, but [very likely] wont work and neither be compiled.
Documents here were made (and included) when i was programming in 'Borland C++' for MS-DOS.
This is not for Windows or Unix, however, for practical reasons, like, the need for syntax highlight,
i also open such headers in IDEs from other OSs.

Unlike some other directories i make for other systems, where the headers have codes to output useful
things for such systems (ex.: a header that outputs opcodes for a game console), this directory is to be
used by MD-DOS system. This may be intuitive when you use things in this directory, but looks counter-intuitive
in comparison to how i organize other directories.
One example is the extension '.HPP', since Borland C++ identifies it is a C++ code instead of opening the file
in a C environment.
