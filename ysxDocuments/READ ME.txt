Things in this directory are directly related to text, human-readable documents, strings and things like that.
It does not deal with parsers, even if parsers are also human-readable, parsers in most time are not read
by humans and it is more like an autonomous proccess.
Parsers, programming languages and things like that have a special way to deal with that are not exactly
related to things in this directory, BUT may use some functions and classes found here!

If you want things related to coding, you may want to check headers at:
'ysxCode'.

Some stuffs here are very old, when i began coding, and so, some codes are very likely horrible to see!
